This repository contains the complete **ROS 2 Humble** workspace of our **Final Year Engineering Project**<br> 
‚Äî an **Autonomous Mobile Robot** developed for educational and research purposes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Design & Development of Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR)

## üéØ Project Highlights:-

- All AMR processes are controlled/operated through laptop via **SSH**
- **Autonomous Navigation** with real time **Obstacle Avoidance** is done by using open source ROS 2 **Nav2** stack
- **SLAM Mapping** with YDLiDAR X2 and RViz2 using open source ROS 2 **SLAM TOOLBOX** Package
- **Teleoperation** is done via keyboard
- **Encoder-based Odometry** is used for accurate localization 
- Custom Robot **URDF** is made for RViz Visualization
- All the commands are executed on "RPI terminals" via SSH except "Rviz & URDF" which is executed on "laptop terminal" to avoid the lagging and reduce the load on RPI. For this just keep "export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0" same in .bashrc file of both Laptop & RPI

## üöÄ How to build ws on your system:-
-  **If you have similar software & hardware setup on your AMR you can directly use this repo to build your workspace and have fun with your AMR**
-  Step 1- Copy the repo (src & config folder only) in your amr_ws then build all the packages available in "src" folder one by one to avoid any errors.
-  Step 2- Modify and configure the .yaml & launch files with correct file names & their paths as per you setup or requirement.
-  Step 3- Ensure you upload the correct code in your arduino which is available in this repository.  
-  Step 4- Do all the hardware & electronics connections properly and then test everything.
-  Step 5- Tune the parameters accordingly if your setup is a bit different.
